the anna hiss gymnasium, otherwise known as the AHG is a building at the University of Texas at Austin
The Anna Hiss Gym (AHG) adaptive reuse project began planning in January 2017 and was completed in June 2021. The focus was to repair and rehabilitate the entire building, including roof and windows, to support the universityâ€™s partnership with the Army Futures Command modernization program, as well as support research and academic programs for Texas Robotics (Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering) and the College of Fine Arts. Many features of the original building were maintained to preserve the historic accuracy where possible. The building is now fully operational and research is ongoing.
